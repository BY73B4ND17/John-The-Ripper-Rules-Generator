# John-The-Ripper-Rules-Generator
This is a Python script that generates every possible 4-digit and leetspeak rule combination for John The Ripper password hash cracking tool and prints them to the console one by one.
(To be used only as per requirement, as the no. of rules generated might be in millions, leading to choke up of system resources)
